You must be coming in off the long and dusty trail, so many potential engineers, so little time. But you've come my way, you must have heard talk of a developer that has a taste for React and Ruby on Rails, and gets weak in the knees talking about the Redux Toolkit. Well pardner, you came to the right place. So sit back and relax and let the cool water of my github wash the trail off and quench your thirst for your next software engineer.

Besides my personal proclivity for using the greeting 'Howdy', let me tell you a little bit more about myself: 

üç± ¬∑ I am a JavaScript and Sushi enthusiast with a soft spot for Ruby and Musubi. I really enjoy making apps that help create, inspire, or reduce stress.

üç≤ ¬∑ I have a place in my heart for cooking and creating apps that interact with food, because at the heart of food is community.

üèó ¬∑ I am a community builder, I believe everyone has a unique skill or vision and I love seeing it piece together.

## TinderLike Cards ‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è

[![Kotlin Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-kotlin%20100%25-orange.svg)](https://kotlinlang.org/)

This project arose from the idea of turning a small part of freelance project I did a long time ago into a library. With TinderLike Cards library, you can easily have a tinder-style design. Since the project was written in the past, it may have problems. I will continue to improve the library with your help. Please be sure to report any issues you find. I took the structure of listview as an example for myself. You can easily include it in your project with the use of a simple adapter. :facepunch:
