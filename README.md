You must be coming in off the long and dusty trail, so many potential engineers, so little time. But you've come my way, you must have heard talk of a developer that has a taste for React and Ruby on Rails, a developer that gets weak in the knees talking about the Redux Toolkit. Well pardner, you came to the right place. So sit back and relax and let the cool water of my github wash the trail off and quench your thirst for your next software engineer.

# A Campfire Yarn. 🏕

Besides my personal proclivity for using the greeting 'Howdy', let me tell you a little bit more about myself: 

🍱 · I am a JavaScript and Sushi enthusiast with a soft spot for Ruby and Musubi. I really enjoy making apps that help create, inspire, or reduce stress.

🍲 · I have a place in my heart for cooking and creating apps that interact with food, because at the heart of food is community.

🏗 · I am a community builder, I believe everyone has a unique skill or vision and I love seeing it piece together.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my personal portfolio site at the moment. I am also working on implementing a Node.js / Express backend for a project I made a while ago. 

- 🌱 I am currently learning about WebSockets in Ruby on Rails. I have live chat on my radar.

- 👯 I would love to collaborate on creating a system of generators for the Redux Toolkit coupled with the Rails as an API, I have a crazy idea but I think that they play really well together and would love to explore that idea more. 

- 🤔 I would love to interact more with the redux toolkit, got a mad crush on what they are doing. Also, I am really digging Ruby on Rails so anything that lemme know. 
I would love to mess around with raspberry pi, I just think it would be fun to have that experience. Have you done it? Lemme know.

- 💬 Ask me about ...
What it is like working in Pike Place Market as an executive chef? BUSY. What it is like working at a burlesque dinner theater? The secrets will have to be told over my live chat when I get it up and running. 

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him but honestly feel more akin to 'Thing' most days. 

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love stories. I am a huge book nerd and love world building. 

📚 Most recent reads: 
- 'Eloquent Javascript' by Marijn Haverbeke
- 'Gideon the Ninth' by Tamsyn Muir

Lets talk coding or books, hit me up on twitter or linkedIn!
