You must be coming in off the long and dusty trail, so many potential engineers, so little time. But you've come my way, you must have heard talk of a developer that has a taste for React and Ruby on Rails, a developer that gets weak in the knees talking about the Redux Toolkit. Well pardner, you came to the right place. So sit back and relax and let the cool water of my github wash the trail off and quench your thirst for your next software engineer.

# A Campfire Yarn. 🏕

Besides my personal proclivity for using the greeting 'Howdy', let me tell you a little bit more about myself: 

- 💬 Ask me about ...
What it is like working in Pike Place Market as an executive chef? BUSY. What it is like working at a burlesque dinner theater? The secrets will have to be told over a great cocktail in a dark bar.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him but honestly feel more akin to 'Thing' most days. 

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love stories. I am a huge book nerd and love world building. 

📚 Books. I love 'em. Here is my reading list: 
- RESTful Web Services by Leonard Richardson
- Database Design for Mere Mortals: A Hands-On Guide to Relational Database Design by Michael J. Hernandez
- Metaprogramming in Ruby by Paolo Perrotta
